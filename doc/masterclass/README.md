# Open edX Plugin Masterclass

A collaborative project to create an online course, hosted on Open edX software obviously, that provides comprehensive instruction on the development of good Open edX plugins.

## Syllabus

### Module I: "Hello World!"

(instructor: [Volunteer to instruct this lesson](./CONTRIBUTORS.md))

the classical starting point. this module will be a detailed step-by-step green shoots project to create a plugin from scratch that implements a new URL that returns a json dict with a "hello-world" key and value. the teaching objective is to demonstrate the exact minimum necessities for creating a plugin that is discoverable by open edx and that returns a static result from a new URL endpoint.

### Module II: The Open edX plugin framework's technical architecture

(instructor: [Volunteer to instruct this lesson](./CONTRIBUTORS.md))

This will be a detailed deep-dive into how Open edX and Django discover and consume an Open edX plugin, as well as what a plugin needs to include in order for it to be discovered, and why.

### Module III: Good programming practice

(instructor: [Volunteer to instruct this lesson](./CONTRIBUTORS.md))

this modules begins with hello world, and then adds the following:

- refactor to leverage openedx helper constants and plugin utility functions
- a README
- additional meta data to setup.py
- add __about__.py
- add a makefile
- add a LICENSE.txt
- add a CHANGELOG.md
